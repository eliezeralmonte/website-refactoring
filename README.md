# READ ME DOCUMENT

Hello team, this is a Read Me file going over some of the things that were done to both Index.html and the CSS side of the refactoring for this website.

*Please note that we've been able to refactor this file without altering the functionality nor the features of the original .html file.*

## ACCESSIBILITY:

In order to comply with accessibility standards as well as search engine optimization we were able to include **a more specific title** for the services Horiseon offers, we believe this will help our site achieve a higher priority within search engines user queries.

We've also been able to add the readable text within images **using the 'alt' attribute for every image to add a descriptive detail for users** who might not be able to see or load these images.

## SEMANTICS:

### Elements:

* **Body**: 
We've been able to identify opportunities within our **body container** of our html file structure to edit and modify some div elements and change them to a more appropriate semantic reference.

* **Header**: Starting with our header, our header contains a navigation menu of 3 line items that lead the user to their desired directory within the website, this div was changed to 'header'.

* **Main and Aside**: Within our body we also have 2 other divs including broader information on the services Horiseon offers, one containing the main content, we've changed this div to 'main', and a side div positioned to the right which we've renamed to 'aside'.

* **Footer**: And finally our footer, we've renamed the div container at the end of our body to 'footer'.  

### Concision:

1. We were able to identify opportunities in which there were unnecessary unexisting ids within our linked CCS file being used for some of the elements within our body, we have removed these ids from the containers.
2. We were also able to refactor some of the classes within our CSS file being able to maintain same functionality and reducing the amount of unnecessary classes.
